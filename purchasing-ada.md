# Purchasing ADA

{% hint style="warning" %}
Please note that all exchanges will have a different look-and-feel as well as differ from one another based on factors highlighted in the "[Choosing an exchange](choosing-an-exchange.md)" section of this guide. 
{% endhint %}

Navigate to the **Buy/Sell** page and you should see something similar to this:

![](.gitbook/assets/copinspot_buy_sell_page.png)

From here you can examine cryptocurrency price charts, buy and sell coins. **Let's buy some ADA!**

## **Check your exchange wallet's balance**

Your newly bought ADA is now in your exchange wallet. You can view its contents and perform a number of other operations by clicking on **"Wallets"**.

{% hint style="info" %}
Please take your time to examine your exchange wallet and its features. Here you can view your balance, buy/sell coins, see your order history and excute transactions to and from other wallets. The latter will be the focus of our next section. 
{% endhint %}
