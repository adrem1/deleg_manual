# ðŸ’° 2. Purchasing ADA

{% hint style="info" %}
All exchanges will have a different look-and-feel as well as differ from one another based on factors highlighted in the "[Choosing an exchange](choosing-an-exchange.md)" section of this guide.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="danger" %}
**Important**: make sure that your exchange of choice allows withdrawal of ADA into self-custody wallets.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

## **Create an account and complete KYC**

Once you have chosen an exchange, create an account and complete the required Know-Your-Customer (KYC) steps in order to enable transactions to and from your new account.&#x20;

{% hint style="danger" %}
While it is possible still to trade in crypto without KYC, we do not recommend it. KYC is an important compliance step for financial institutions: exchanges that do not implement is should be avoided.  &#x20;
{% endhint %}

## **Fund your exchange account**

Once you have completed the KYC steps required by your exchange of choice, you will have to transfer some funds in order to buy ADA.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Most exchanges will allow a number of payment methods: please refer to your exchange's FAQs or Support for more details.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

## Buying ADA

Each exchange will have its own UI to allow customers to purchase ADA and other crypto. Some will provide swaps, spot prices, market orders and more.&#x20;

{% hint style="warning" %}
Please familiarise yourself with the UI of your exchange, and consult independent market-price aggregators when you purchase crypto.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

Once you have bought ADA, the coins will be in your exchange wallet. In the next part of this guide, you'll learn how to transfer ADA out of those wallets into your own.

{% hint style="info" %}
Please take your time to examine your exchange wallet and its features. Here you will generally be able to view your balance, trade coins, see your order history and execute transactions to and from other wallets.
