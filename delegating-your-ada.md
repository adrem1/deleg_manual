# ü§ù 5. Delegating your ADA

{% hint style="info" %}
When you delegate your funds, these remain in your **full control**. Cardano also has **no lock-in** period.
{% endhint %}

## Delegating to a Stake Pool&#x20;

Now that you've [created your wallet](choosing-a-wallet-app/) and [funded it](sending-ada-to-your-personal-wallet.md), you want to consider delegating to a Stake Pool.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Your first delegation will incur a (refundable) **delegation fee**. Should you delegate your funds to a different pool, your operation will only incur a **small transaction fee** (non refundable).
{% endhint %}

There is no valid reason not to delegate your stake to a Pool and it can be done by following the steps below. If you would like to know more about Staking on Cardano, please refer to the original post by [Prof. Aggelos Kiayias, Chief Scientist for Cardano](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2020/11/13/the-general-perspective-on-staking-in-cardano/).

{% hint style="info" %}
Some [exchanges](choosing-an-exchange.md) offer Cardano staking services. It is always best to transfer your funds off exchanges and delegate to a Stake Pool instead. Learn why [here](further-reading/exchange-vs-spo-staking.md).
{% endhint %}

## Choosing a Stake Pool

Making recommendations about individual Stake Pools is not the scope of this guide. There are some excellent tips in [Selecting a Pool for your Delegation](https://cardano-community.github.io/support-faq/select-pool-to-delegate/).

{% hint style="warning" %}
Do your own research!
{% endhint %}

You can also check out these [Stake Pool Alliances](further-reading/some-links-of-interest.md) if you wish.&#x20;

{% hint style="warning" %}
Use [Explorers](further-reading/some-links-of-interest.md) to monitor the **performance of your stake pool of choice**: if a pool does not mint any new blocks in an Epoch, neither you nor the stake pool operator will earn rewards.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

## Delegating from Daedalus

Navigate to (1) the Delegation Centre and choose (2) Stake Pools:

![](.gitbook/assets/daedalus\_deleg.png)

Search for the pool you wish to delegate to and select "**Delegate to this pool**":

![](.gitbook/assets/daedalus\_deleg\_rabit\_anonymised.png)

In the following dialogue, **select the wallet** to delegate from:

![](.gitbook/assets/daedalus\_choose\_deleg\_wallet.PNG)

You will now be prompted to enter your **spending password** to confirm delegation preferences:

![](.gitbook/assets/daedalus\_deleg\_confirm\_anonymised.png)

{% hint style="warning" %}
It is recommended to **change your spending password every time you use it**.
{% endhint %}

Once **delegation is successful** you should see this dialogue box:

## Delegating from Yoroi

From the "**Delegation List**" tab, 1) **search** for your selected **stake pool** and 2) click "**DELEGATE**":&#x20;

![](.gitbook/assets/yoroi\_delegate\_01\_anonymised.png)

Next**, confirm the transaction**. You will be asked to **enter your spending password**:

![](.gitbook/assets/yoroi\_delegate\_02.png)

{% hint style="warning" %}
We recommend changing your spending password each time you use it.
{% endhint %}

Once **delegation is successful** you should see this dialogue box:

## Delegating from Eternl

{% hint style="info" %}
The pools in the images below are intentionally deleted. Your staking page will look slightly different.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

Click on **Staking** from your Wallet's page**:**

Type the **name or ticker of the pool** you wish to delegate to:

<div>

<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/eternl_deleg02.PNG" alt=""><figcaption><p>Type the name of your pool of choice</p></figcaption></figure>

 

<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/eternl_deleg03.PNG" alt=""><figcaption><p>Click the Delegate button</p></figcaption></figure>

</div>

In the dialogue that follows, enter your **spending password** and click **Sign**:

<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/eternl_deleg04.PNG" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

{% hint style="success" %}
Back on your wallet's main page (**Account > Summary**), you'll see the **updated balance** (after fees and deposit of the stake key) and your **pool preference**.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

## Congratulations!

Your ADA is now delegated to a stake pool :clap: : you are **actively securing Cardano**, while **earning ADA rewards**!

{% hint style="success" %}
**Success!** Now that your wallet is delegated to a pool, you will start accruing rewards. The funds are still in your **full control**: you can spend them, transfer them, delegate them to a different pool.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
All changes in Cardano take 2 epochs to take effect (delegation, reward distribution, etc). More on this topic on [Cardanians' Medium](https://cardanians-io.medium.com/cardano-staking-practical-information-3c86cbc73bd4).
