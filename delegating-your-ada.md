# ü§ù 5. Delegating your ADA

{% hint style="info" %}
When you delegate your funds, these remain in your **full control**. Cardano also has **no lock-in** period.
{% endhint %}

Now that you've [created your wallet](choosing-a-wallet-app/) and [funded it](sending-ada-to-your-personal-wallet.md), you want to consider delegating to a Stake Pool.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Your first delegation will incur a (refundable) **delegation fee**. Should you delegate your funds to a different pool, your operation will only incur a **small transaction fee** (non refundable).
{% endhint %}

There is no valid reason not to delegate your stake to a Pool and it can be done by following the steps below. If you would like to know more about Staking on Cardano, please refer to the original post by [Prof. Aggelos Kiayias, Chief Scientist for Cardano](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2020/11/13/the-general-perspective-on-staking-in-cardano/).

{% hint style="info" %}
Some [exchanges](choosing-an-exchange.md) offer Cardano staking services. It is always best to transfer your funds off exchanges and delegate to a Stake Pool instead. Learn why [here](further-reading/exchange-vs-spo-staking.md).
{% endhint %}

## Delegating from Daedalus

Navigate to (1) the Delegation Centre and choose (2) Stake Pools:

![](.gitbook/assets/daedalus\_deleg.png)

Search for the pool you wish to delegate to and select "**Delegate to this pool**":

![](.gitbook/assets/daedalus\_deleg\_rabit\_anonymised.png)

In the following dialogue, **select the wallet** to delegate from:

![](.gitbook/assets/daedalus\_choose\_deleg\_wallet.PNG)

You will now be prompted to enter your **spending password** to confirm delegation preferences:

{% hint style="warning" %}
It is recommended to **change your spending password every time you use it**.
{% endhint %}

Once **delegation is successful** you should see this dialogue box:

## Delegating from Yoroi

From the "**Delegation List**" tab, 1) **search** for your selected **stake pool** and 2) click "**DELEGATE**":&#x20;

![](.gitbook/assets/yoroi\_delegate\_01\_anonymised.png)

Next**, confirm the transaction**. You will be asked to **enter your spending password**:

![](.gitbook/assets/yoroi\_delegate\_02.png)

{% hint style="warning" %}
We recommend changing your spending password each time you use it.
{% endhint %}

Once **delegation is successful** you should see this dialogue box:

## Delegating from Eternl

{% hint style="danger" %}
Work in Progress
{% endhint %}

## Congratulations!

Your ADA is now delegated to a stake pool :clap: : you are **actively securing Cardano**, while **earning ADA rewards**!

{% hint style="info" %}
Please note that, like your delegation preferences, **staking rewards** are paid out to you after 2 Epochs have passed since rewards were calculated.

Monitor the **performance of your stake pool of choice**: if a pool does not mint any new blocks in an Epoch, neither you nor the stake pool operator will earn rewards.&#x20;
