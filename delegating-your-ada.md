  Daedalus and Yoroi

# 5. Delegating your ADA

{% hint style="danger" %}
When you delegate your funds, these remain in your **full control**. Cardano also has **no lock-in** period.

Your first delegation will incur a \(refundable\) **delegation fee**. Should you delegate your funds to a different pool, your operation will only incur a **small transaction fee** \(non refundable\). 
{% endhint %}

## Delegating from Daedalus

Navigate to \(1\) the Delegation Centre and choose \(2\) Stake Pools:

Search for the pool you wish to delegate to and select "**Delegate to this pool**":
