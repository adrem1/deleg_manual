# 4. Sending ADA to your personal wallet

## Receiving funds in Daedalus

From your wallet top menu, navigate to **Receive**:

![](.gitbook/assets/daedalus_receive.png)

{% hint style="info" %}
You will **not** need a **password to receive** funds, anyone can send you funds without your authorisationüòé. The addresses below are blurred out intentionally, to prevent this, as the wallet in these pages is a test wallet only. 
{% endhint %}

Choose one of the available addresses:

![](.gitbook/assets/daedalus_receive_02.png)

{% hint style="warning" %}
Always choose a different address when receiving funds: this will protect your privacy. Funds will all go to the same wallet. 
{% endhint %}

In the popup choose "Copy address":

![](.gitbook/assets/daedalus_share_address.png)

Now go back to your exchange wallet, in Coinspot once you open your ADA wallet, you will find the "Send" button:

![](.gitbook/assets/coinspot_send.png)

{% hint style="info" %}
In the dialogue that follows, paste the address you copied from Daedalus.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
Please ensure that the amount you wish to send is present in your exchange wallet \(including transaction fees\).
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="danger" %}
Coinspot will ask for your 2FA and also send you a confirmation email prior to withdrawal of funds. 
{% endhint %}

Please check back in your Daedalus wallet: **your funds have been transferred** and can now be delegated to a stake pool üëè
