# ðŸ”Œ 7. Third Party Wallets

{% hint style="warning" %}
This guide is not associated directly or indirectly with the developers of any of the wallets listed herein.
{% endhint %}

## Compatibility

Most wallets listed here are compatible with mnemonic phrases from other wallets (please see [Installing a wallet app](installing-a-wallet-app/)). This means that one could import a Yoroi or Daedalus wallet into any of them.&#x20;

## Web3

You can experience Web3 through the use of some of these wallets. As **web-browser extensions** some wallets allow users to **connect to Cardano Decentralised Applications** (dApps) such as Decentralised Exchanges (DEXs) and token distribution platforms. In some cases, the wallets provide dApp browsers which include popular Cardano dApps.&#x20;

## NFT collections

Some of these wallets provide the user with **intuitive interfaces to visualise and list native assets**, including Fungible Tokens (FTs) and Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs).&#x20;

## Metadata

Some of these wallets allow users to easily **include metadata in transactions**. This is increasingly useful, to include messages in your transaction and for governance purposes.   &#x20;

## Wallet list

For an up-to-date list of currently available Cardano Wallets, please refer to [Essentials Cardano](https://www.essentialcardano.io/article/wallets).&#x20;

{% hint style="warning" %}
All wallets provide varying User Experiences (UXs). Please read the official documentation carefully and choose based on your level of comfort around new software.
