## What are hardware wallets?

A hardware wallet is a physical device to store your cryptocurrency private keys away from the internet. Hardware wallets confirm transactions in an offline environment: this helps keep your private keys away from the risks of the internet.

## Why should you consider a hardware wallet?

The offline nature of hardware wallets keeps them safe from online threats like hacking and malware: physical isolation significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized access.&#x20;

Easy-to-use recovery phrases ensure that users can regain access to their funds if the device is lost or damaged.&#x20;
