# ðŸ’¹ 1. Choosing an exchange

## Think about tax time

Nobody likes to think about tax time. But we kind of have to. Some jurisdictions treat cryptocurrencies as commodities, some as securities, some are flat-out trying to ban them. Where you are in the world will determine when and how your crypto earnings will be taxed.&#x20;

Do some research ahead of time, to avoid unpleasant surprises.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
Some exchanges provide end-of-financial year reports, accepted by your jurisdictional taxation office.

## Reputation matters

{% hint style="danger" %}
There are a multitude of cryptocurrency exchanges in the world. Choosing one that is appropriately regulated in your jurisdiction and has a good reputation can make a lot of difference.
{% endhint %}

Make sure your exchange of choice has a good reputation. Things to look out for include:

* **Years of activity** (how long have they been around for?);
* Whether the exchange will allow **cryptocurrency withdrawal** into personal wallets (you will not be able to stake otherwise);
* **Awards and certifications** from competent organs;
* **Bad press** or allegations of **criminal behaviour**;
* Quality of **customer-support**;
* **Transparency** of dealings with the community.
