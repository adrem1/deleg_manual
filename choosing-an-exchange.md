# Choosing an exchange

## Think about tax time

Nobody likes to think about tax time. But we kind of have to. Some jurisdictions treat cryptocurrencies as commodities, some as securities, some are flat-out trying to ban them. Where you are in the world will determine when and how your crypto earnings will be treated. Do some research ahead of time, to avoid unpleasant surprises. 

## Reputation matters

Make sure your exchange of choice has a good reputation. Things to look out for include:

* Years of activity \(how long have they been around for?\);
* Awards and certifications from competend organs;
* Bad press or allegations of criminal behaviour;
* Quality of customer-support;
* Transparency of dealings with the community.

## An example: Coinspot
