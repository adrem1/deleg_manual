## Exchange \(hot\) vs personal \(cold\) wallets

Exchanges go to great lengths to guarantee your funds are safe. Nonetheless, like any other **big** store of value, exchange wallets can become targets for nefarious activity. In the context of a **long-term** investment, your hard-earned cryptocurrencies will be safer in a personal \(cold\) wallet which you control rather than an exchange \(hot\) wallet.

 Funds stored on personal \(cold\) wallets need to be moved to an exchange \(hot\) wallet to be traded into fiat or other cryptos.
{% endhint %}
