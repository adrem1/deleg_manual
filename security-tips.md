# Security tips

## Exchange \(hot\) vs personal \(cold\) wallets

Exchanges go to great lengths to guarantee your funds are safe. Nonetheless, like any other **big** store of value, exchange wallets can become targets for nefarious activity. In the context of a **long-term** investment, your hard-earned cryptocurrencies will be safer in a personal \(cold\) wallet which you control rather than an exchange \(hot\) wallet.  

{% hint style="info" %}
 Funds stored on personal \(cold\) wallets need to be moved to an exchange \(hot\) wallet to be traded into fiat or other cryptos.
{% endhint %}

## A word from the experts

Below you can watch a video by **Charles Hoskinson** \(the inventor of Cardano\) on safety tips for keeping your crypto safe.

## Don't underestimate the power of paper

Both Cardano Wallets we will be talking about later in this guide use a multi-word **mnemonic phrase** \(24 for Daedalus and 15 for Yoroi\) to recover your wallet should you loose access to your device \(broken, stolen, etc\). 

{% hint style="danger" %}
**Never** store this mnemonic digitally, unless you have a security setup that allows you to do so safely \(eg Air-gapped machine, in which case you probably don't need this guide\). 
{% endhint %}

Store your mnemonic on **paper** \(a Moleskine or similar will do\): make 3 copies and keep them in at least 2 separate _physical_ locations.
