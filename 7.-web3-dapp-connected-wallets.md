# ðŸ”Œ 7. Web3 dApp-connected Wallets

{% hint style="warning" %}
This guide is not associated directly or indirectly with the developers of any of the wallets listed herein. The guide is publicly versionable and does (if desired) provide the option for developers to add information about their own wallets.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

## A couple of notes

All the wallets listed here are compatible with mnemonic phrases from other wallets (please see [Installing a wallet app](installing-a-wallet-app/)). This means that one could import a Yoroi or Daedalus wallet into any of them.&#x20;

All these wallets function as **web-browser extensions** and allow users to **connect to Cardano Decentralized Applications** (dApps) such as Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs) and token distribution platforms. In some cases, the wallets provide dApp browsers which include popular Cardano dApps.&#x20;

Further, these wallets provide the user with **intutitive interfaces to visualise and list native tokens**, as well as other functionalities (for example the ability to easily **include metadata in transactions**).  &#x20;

Although by no means exhaustive, below is an alphabetical list of currently available Cardano next-gen wallets.&#x20;
