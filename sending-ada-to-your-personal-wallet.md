# ↔️ 4. Sending ADA to your personal wallet

{% hint style="info" %}
You will **not** need a **password to receive** funds, anyone can send you funds without your authorisation:sunglasses:
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
Choosing a different address when receiving funds will help protect your privacy. Funds will all go to the same wallet.
{% endhint %}

## Receiving funds in Daedalus

From your wallet top menu, navigate to **Receive**:

![](.gitbook/assets/daedalus\_receive.png)

Choose one of the available addresses:

![](.gitbook/assets/daedalus\_receive\_02.png)

In the popup choose "Copy address":

![](.gitbook/assets/daedalus\_share\_address.png)

## Receiving funds in Yoroi

In the "**Receive**" tab, **copy the address to your clipboard**:

![](.gitbook/assets/yoroi\_receive.png)

## Send from your exchange wallet

Now that you have copied your receive address, it is time to fund it by sending ADA from your exchange to it.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Please note that each exchange will have a different UI to handle withdrawals of crypto. If in doubt, refer to your exchange's documentation.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
Please ensure that the **amount you wish to send is present** in your exchange wallet (including transaction fees).
{% endhint %}

Go **back to your exchange wallet** and paste the receive address you just copied in the appropriate section to initiate a transfer.

{% hint style="danger" %}
Always double check the address you are sending to: if you accidentally transfer your ADA to an address you do not control, recovering your funds will not be possible.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

## Confirm receipt of your funds

Please check back in your **Daedalus** or **Yoroi** wallet: **your funds have been transferred** and can now be delegated to a stake pool :clap:&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Please note that, while rather quick, **the transfer of ADA from an exchange wallet to yours is not instant**. If you have doubts about your outgoing (withdrawal) transactions, please contact your exchange support.&#x20;
{% endhint %}
