# Yoroi

## Configure Yoroi

Once you have installed Yoroi \(this example is based on the browser extension\), please configure it: 

![Select your language and click continue](../.gitbook/assets/yoroi_splash%20%281%29.png)

![Read and accept the terms of use, then click continue](../.gitbook/assets/yoroi_terms.png)

![Choose interface complexity, we have chosen &quot;Simple&quot; for this example](../.gitbook/assets/yoroi_interface_choice.png)

![Configure payment URLs to your preference \(if you skip this step you can enable this option later\)](../.gitbook/assets/yoroi_payment_urls.png)

You are now ready to **create your ADA wallet** in Yoroi, please select "**Create wallet**":

Then, "**Create wallet**":

Configure your wallet with a **name and password**:

{% hint style="warning" %}
Your wallet name and password are only stored locally. If you were to loose access to your wallet, the **recovery phrase** \(see below\) is the only means to recover your wallet. If you need to do this, you will be prompted for a new name and password.  
{% endhint %}
