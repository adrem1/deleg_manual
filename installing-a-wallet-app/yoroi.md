# Yoroi

## Configure Yoroi

Once you have installed Yoroi \(this example is based on the browser extension\), please configure it. First, **select your language** and click **continue**:

Read and accept the **terms of use**, then click **continue**:

## Create your wallet in Yoroi

You are now ready to **create your ADA wallet** in Yoroi, please select "**Create wallet**":

![](../.gitbook/assets/yoroi_main.png)

In the popup that follows, choose "**Cardano**":

![](../.gitbook/assets/yoroi_currency_choice.png)

Then, "**Create wallet**":

![](../.gitbook/assets/yaroi_wallet_type.png)

Configure your wallet with a **name and password**:

{% hint style="warning" %}
Your wallet name and password are only stored locally. If you loose access to your wallet, the **recovery phrase** \(see below\) is the only means to recover your wallet. If you need to do this, you will be prompted for a new name and password.  
{% endhint %}

![](../.gitbook/assets/yoroi_wallet_config.png)

You will be asked to write down a **15-word recovery phrase**:

{% hint style="danger" %}
As discussed previously, please take all necessary precautions to **keep your recovery phrase safe**!
{% endhint %}

![](../.gitbook/assets/yoroi_recovery_phrase_01.png)

Write the words on **paper**, and make **multiple copies**! When prompted, **check** that you have written the correct phrase, **read** the instructions, and **confirm**:

Your new **Yoroi wallet** is ready to be funded üòç :

{% hint style="info" %}
Take your time to navigate Yoroi's interface and familiarise yourself with it. Below you will learn what to do in case you should loose access to your wallet. 
{% endhint %}

## Recovering a Yoroi wallet

Should you loose access to your Yoroi software for whichever reason \(machine broken/lost/stolen\), please use your **recovery phrase** to restore it. Choose "**Restore wallet**" ****in the following menu:

![](../.gitbook/assets/yoroi_restore_01.png)

Then pick "**Cardano**":

![](../.gitbook/assets/yoroi_currency_choice.png)

If restoring a Yoroi wallet, please choose "**Enter a 15-word recovery phrase**":

![](../.gitbook/assets/yoroi_restore_02.png)

And then, choose "**Shelley-era wallet**":

![](../.gitbook/assets/yoroi_restore_03.png)

{% hint style="info" %}
**Please note**: this method of recovery works for older Yoroi wallets as well, and for Daedalus wallets \(in the latter case you will have to choose 24-word recovery phrases\).
{% endhint %}

In the following dialogue, you must enter the **recovery phrase**: 

![](../.gitbook/assets/yoroi_restore_04.png)

While entering your **recovery phrase**, you are prompted for a **new** wallet **name** and **password**. This was already noted above, and is important because:

{% hint style="danger" %}
Should someone get a hold of your **recovery phrase**, they can restore your wallet and **gain full control** of it, **even if they don't know your spending password** \(they will be asked, like you just then, to make a new password\).
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="danger" %}
Should you ever **loose** a copy of your **recovery phrase**, you must consider **your wallet compromised**, and transfer its contents to a new one.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
You now have all the tools you need to **manage your Yoroi wallets**. Please use your judgement and take time to practice **creating**, **deleting** and **restoring** wallets, in order to gain confidence.
{% endhint %}
