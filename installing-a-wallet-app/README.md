# Installing a wallet app

## Daedalus

Daedalus is a **Cardano Wallet** made by [IOG ](https://iohk.io/)\(the developing company behind Cardano\). It is a desktop application, which works with all major Operating Systems \(Windows, MacOS and Linux\). 

> Daedalus is a full node wallet. This means that unlike light wallets \(e.g.Yoroi, Adalite etc.\) Daedalus downloads a full copy of the Cardano blockchain and independently validates every transaction in its history. That way you get maximum security and completely trustless operation, without centrally hosted 3rd party servers.

Daedalus can be downloaded here: [https://daedaluswallet.io/](https://daedaluswallet.io/)

{% hint style="danger" %}
Do **not** trust any other sources than the one linked above for Daedalus downloads. **Always check the URL** you are downloading from!
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="danger" %}
Always check that you are downloading verified software. **Follow the instructions** on the Download page, and verify signature and checksum!
{% endhint %}

## Yoroi
