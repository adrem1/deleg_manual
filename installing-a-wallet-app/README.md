# ðŸ‘‰ 3. Choosing a wallet app

{% hint style="info" %}
The **Cardano Ecosystem has grown dramatically** since this guide was first written. Cardano is now capable of running **Decentralized Applications (dApps)** and has seen a number of **new third-party wallets** being developed and released, which are capable of **seamlessly connecting to dApps**.



Please refer to [this page](../7.-web3-dapp-connected-wallets.md) for a list of current wallets.

## Choosing the wallet that is right for you

Which wallet you choose to install is ultimately up to you. Considerations that may help you choose are:

* System requirements;
* Device of choice;
* Ease of use;
* Appeal of interface.
