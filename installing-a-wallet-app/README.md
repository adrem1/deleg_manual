# ðŸ‘‰ 3. Installing a wallet app

{% hint style="info" %}
The **Cardano Ecosystem has grown dramatically** since this guide was first written. Cardano is now capable of running **Decentralized Applications (dApps)** and has seen a number of **new third-party wallets** being developed and released, which are capable of **seamlessly connecting to dApps**.



If you are ready to explore **Web3 on Cardano**, please refer to [this page](../7.-web3-dapp-connected-wallets.md) for a list of current wallets.   &#x20;

## Yoroi

Yoroi is a **Cardano Wallet** developed by [Emurgo](https://emurgo.io/), the commercial partner for Cardano. It is available as an **extension for all major browsers** (Chrome, Firefox, Edge) and as a **mobile app for both Android and iOS**.

> Yoroi is a light wallet for Cardano. Itâ€™s simple, fast and secure. Yoroi is an Emurgo product, engineered by IOHK. And it follows best practices for software in the industry including a comprehensive security audit. Daedalus and Yoroi are complements to what they try to achieve. Yoroi looks to be a day to day wallet for a Cardano user.

## Choosing the wallet that is right for you

Which wallet you choose to install is ultimately up to you. Considerations that may help you choose are:

* System requirements (check these carefully);
* Ease of use (heavily dependent on your confidence around new software);
* Appeal of interface (entirely subjective).
