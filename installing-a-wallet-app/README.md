# ðŸ‘‰ 3. Installing a wallet app

{% hint style="info" %}
The **Cardano Ecosystem has grown dramatically** since this guide was first written. Cardano is now capable of running **Decentralized Applications (dApps)** and has seen a number of **new third-party wallets** being developed and released, which are capable of **seamlessly connecting to dApps**.



If you are ready to explore **Web3 on Cardano**, please refer to the [new page](../7.-web3-dapp-connected-wallets.md) regarding dApp-connected wallets for a primer.   &#x20;
{% endhint %}

## Daedalus

Daedalus is a **Cardano Wallet** made by [IOG ](https://iohk.io/)(the developing company behind Cardano). It is a desktop application, which works with **all major Operating Systems** (Windows, MacOS and Linux).&#x20;

> Daedalus is a full node wallet. This means that unlike light wallets (e.g.Yoroi, Adalite etc.) Daedalus downloads a full copy of the Cardano blockchain and independently validates every transaction in its history. That way you get maximum security and completely trustless operation, without centrally hosted 3rd party servers.

**Daedalus** can be downloaded here: [https://daedaluswallet.io/](https://daedaluswallet.io/)

{% hint style="danger" %}
Do **not** trust any other sources than the one linked above for Daedalus downloads. **Always check the URL** you are downloading from!
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="danger" %}
Always check that you are downloading verified software. **Follow the instructions** on the Download page, and verify signature and checksum!
{% endhint %}

## Yoroi

Yoroi is a **Cardano Wallet** developed by [Emurgo](https://emurgo.io/), the commercial partner for Cardano. It is available as an **extension for all major browsers** (Chrome, Firefox, Edge) and as a **mobile app for both Android and iOS**.

> Yoroi is a light wallet for Cardano. Itâ€™s simple, fast and secure. Yoroi is an Emurgo product, engineered by IOHK. And it follows best practices for software in the industry including a comprehensive security audit. Daedalus and Yoroi are complements to what they try to achieve. Yoroi looks to be a day to day wallet for a Cardano user.

**Yoroi** can be downloaded here: [https://yoroi-wallet.com/](https://yoroi-wallet.com/#/)

{% hint style="danger" %}
As above, **always check** the URL your are getting software from and **follow** the developer's **instructions** carefully!
{% endhint %}

## Choosing the wallet that is right for you

Which wallet you choose to install is ultimately up to you. Considerations that may help you choose are:

* System requirements (check these carefully);
* Ease of use (heavily dependent on your confidence around new software);
* Appeal of interface (entirely subjective).

{% hint style="info" %}
Once you have chosen your ADA wallet, proceed to the relevant section of this guide for more details:

* [Daedalus](daedalus.md)
* [Yoroi](yoroi.md)
