# ðŸ‘‰ 3. Installing a wallet app

{% hint style="info" %}
The **Cardano Ecosystem has grown dramatically** since this guide was first written. Cardano is now capable of running **Decentralized Applications (dApps)** and has seen a number of **new third-party wallets** being developed and released, which are capable of **seamlessly connecting to dApps**.



If you are ready to explore **Web3 on Cardano**, please refer to [this page](../7.-web3-dapp-connected-wallets.md) for a list of current wallets.   &#x20;

## **Eternl**

[Eternl](https://eternl.io/) is a Cardano light wallet available as a website/progressive web app (PWA), Chrome browser extension, and mobile app on iOS and Android. Here are some of its key features:

* Ledger and Trezor hardware wallet support
* DApp browser to connect to the Cardano ecosystem
* Smart UTXO management and token fragmentation

## Choosing the wallet that is right for you

Which wallet you choose to install is ultimately up to you. Considerations that may help you choose are:

* System requirements (check these carefully);
* Ease of use (heavily dependent on your confidence around new software);
* Appeal of interface (entirely subjective).
