# Daedalus

{% hint style="danger" %}
At the time of this writing \(March 10th 2021\) a mobile version of Daedalus has **NOT** been released. Numerous **scams** have been reported, claiming Daedalus can be used on mobile. This is **NOT** the case and you should **NOT** trust these claims.  
{% endhint %}

## Let Daedalus sync to the blockchain

Once you have downloaded and verified Daedalus \(see previous section\) configure options as needed:

![Initial Daedalus splash](../.gitbook/assets/daedalus_options_init.png)

Accept the Terms and Conditions:

![Terms of Service checkbox](../.gitbook/assets/daedalus_tandc_accept.png)

{% hint style="danger" %}
At this time it is **important** to let the software **sync to the blockchain**. This process will take time \(hours\). Wait until it has completed **before creating or restoring a wallet**.
{% endhint %}

To check synchronisation progress you can hover over **the circular arrows icon** in the top right corner:

Once Daedalus has **synced to the blockchain** a check mark will appear in the top right corner:

## Recovering a wallet
