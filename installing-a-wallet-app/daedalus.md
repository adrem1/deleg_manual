## Let Daedalus sync to the blockchain

Once you have downloaded and verified Daedalus \(see previous section\) configure options as needed:

Accept the Terms and Conditions:

![Terms of Service checkbox](../.gitbook/assets/daedalus_tandc_accept.png)

{% hint style="danger" %}

{% endhint %}

To check synchronisation progress you can hover over **the circular arrows icon** in the top right corner:
