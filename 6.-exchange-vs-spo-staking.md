# âš– 6. Exchange vs SPO staking

{% hint style="warning" %}
Always do your own research on any crypto-related project and investment!
{% endhint %}

Centralized Exchanges (CEXs) go to great lengths to keep **your** crypto on **their** systems. This has some obvious drawbacks for investors. Let's highlight some important ones:

* Not-your-keys-not-your-crypto
* CEXs, like all big financial institutions are Centralizaed and eventually can run into issues
* Most CEXs have no vested interest in the health of the Ecosystems they trade in
* Most CEXs have lmitations when it comes to staking your ADA with them.

By getting your ADA off CEXs and staking it with independent SPOs, you are helping the **Cardano Ecosystem stay Decentralized**, and you gain more benefits:

* Full independence (self-custody allows direct control of your funds)
* Ability to invest in projects you believe in
* In most cases your RoA (return of ADA) will be larger, as you can stake the full amount you own

If you are uncertain about getting your ADA off exchanges, or how to safely set up self-custodial wallets, please do more research.&#x20;
