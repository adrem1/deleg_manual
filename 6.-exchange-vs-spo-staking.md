# âš– 6. Exchange vs SPO staking

Centralized Exchanges (CEXs) go to great lengths to keep **your** crypto on **their** systems. This has some obvious drawbacks for investors. Let's highlight some important ones:

* Not-your-keys-not-your-crypto
* CEXs, like all big financial institutions are Centralizaed and eventually can run into issues
* Most CEXs have no vested interest in the health of the Ecosystems they trade in
* Most CEXs have lmitations when it comes to staking your ADA with them.

By getting your ADA off CEXs and staking it with independent SPOs, you are helping the **Cardano Ecosystem stay Decentralized**, and you gain more benefits:

* Full independence (self-custody allows direct control of your funds)
* Ability to invest in projects you believe in
* In most cases your RoA (return of ADA) will be larger, as you can stake the full amount you own

Self-custody may sound scary. If you want to learn more about it, so as you can start staking with SPOs with greater confidence, here are a couple of useful resources:
